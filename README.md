# RobBot
The best bot out there :D

# Installation
As usual download it, make sure to have the latest version of NodeJs, satisfy the dependencies by running `npm i`, and populate /Modules/Configs/Secrets.json with this format
```json
{
    "ownerBot": { 
        "id": "Discord Id Of The Owner",
        "ex": true
    },
    "faunaKey": "Your FaunaDB Key Here",
    "token": "Your Bot Token Here"
}
```

# Renaming
Leading upto to the beta stages, I have been renaming this project to many different things like "RobiBot", "RoBot" and I think I have settled on "RobBot"
