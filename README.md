# RobBot
The best bot out there :D
# Installation
As usual download it, make sure to have the latest version of NodeJs 12, satisfy the dependencies by running `npm i`, add the token to /Configs/Secrets.json with this format
```json
{
    "token": "YourBotTokenHere"
}
```
# Configuration
## File locations:
If you desire to move certain folders or files to another location, you can easily do this by reconfiguring LocConfig.json (Will need more documentation), found under the Configs folder. Note that if the config folder location moves relative to Structures, the LocConfig file location will have to be readjusted.

# Renaming
Leading upto to the beta stages, I have been renaming this project to many different things like "RobiBot", "RoBot" and I think I have settled on "RobBot"
