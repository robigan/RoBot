# RobBot
Built on the WeatherStack by Daswolke (Currently using the version maintained by AmandaDiscord), Rabbit MQ, Redis and MongoDB. And based upon DasWolke's Discord [microservice bots whitepaper](https://gist.github.com/DasWolke/c9d7dfe6a78445011162a12abd32091d). Good for large scale.

# Installation
As usual download it, make sure to have the latest version of NodeJs, satisfy the dependencies by running `npm i`, and populate /Modules/Configs/Secrets.json with this format.
```json
{
    "token": "Your Bot Token Here"
}
```
You may want to go over the other config files quickly.

# Renaming
Leading upto to the beta stages, I have been renaming this project to many different things like "RobiBot", "RoBot" and I think I have settled on "RobBot"
